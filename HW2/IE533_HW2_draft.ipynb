    "First, let's prove that if G is acyclic, we can renumber its nodes so that its node-node adjacency matrix is a lower triangular matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "An acyclic directed graph can be topologically sorted, which means that the nodes can be renumbered such that for every directed edge $(u, v)$, node $u$ appears before node $v$ in the ordering. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\because$ If there is an edge $(u, v)$ and $u$ is assigned a lower number than $v$, then the entry in the adjacency matrix for the edge $(u, v)$ will be in a lower row and column than the entry for the edge $(v, u)$ (if it exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore$ If we use this topological ordering as the new numbering of the nodes, the node-node adjacency matrix will be a lower triangular matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the adjacency matrix of a graph is lower triangular, $\\to$ there is no edge from a node with a higher number to a node with a lower number, $\\to$ there are no directed cycles in the graph, and therefore the graph is acyclic.\n",

    "$\\because$ The matrix $M^k$ for $k\\geq 1$ represents the paths of length $k$ between the vertices. $\\therefore$ If there exists an entry $M^k_{i,j} = 1$, it means that there is a path of length $k$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.\n",

    "Conversely, if the graph is strongly connected, there exists a path between every vertex and every other vertex. Hence, for any $n$, there will always exist a path of length $n$ between every vertex and every other vertex, which means that all entries of the sum $M + M^2 + M^3 + ... + M^n$ will be non-zero.\n",
