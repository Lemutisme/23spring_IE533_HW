    "The bubble sort algorithm is a popular method for sorting $n$ numbers in a non-decreasing order of their magnitudes. The algorithm maintains an ordered set of the numbers $\\{a_1, a_2, ... , a_n\\}$  that  it rearranges through a sequence of several passes over the set. In each pass, the algorithm examines every pair of elements $(a_k, a_{k+I})$ for each $k = 1,...,(n-1)$, and if the pair is out of order (i.e., $a_k > a_{k+1}$), it swaps the positions of these elements. The algorithm terminates when it makes no swap during one entire pass. \n",

For every $n$, construct a sorting problem (i.e., the initial ordered set of numbers $\\{a_1, a_2...,a_n\\}$ so that the algorithm performs $\\Omega(n^2)$ operations. Conclude that the bubble sort is an $O(n^2)$ algorithm.\n",
